            <p class="card-text">carbonOS is designed to be minimal and
            intuitive. It gets out of your way and lets you focus on your work.
            Powerful features like system-wide search and the control center
            make it easy to accomplish quick tasks without opening any other
            apps. Features like do not disturb and the overview let you separate
            work and play</p>

            <p class="card-text">Update your systems confidently! carbonOS's
            innovative design makes sure that updates are completely safe to
            install. In fact, updates happen in the background while you're
            working, and all it takes is a reboot to apply them. If something
            does somehow go wrong, carbonOS will automatically <em>undo</em>
            faulty updates! You can also undo updates manually if necessary</p>

            <h5 class="card-title">Keeping You Safe</h5>
            <p class="card-text">carbonOS takes great care to protect you and
            itself from potentially malicious programs. All system files are
            locked and read-only, making it difficult for anything to tamper
            with or hijack the OS.

            All your data is always encrypted and backed-up to protect you from
            ransomware and other attacks. -->

            to ensure that it hasn't been tampered with. -->
            Apps you install are kept isolated from each other, limiting the
            impact of any vulnerabilities or malware.</p>
