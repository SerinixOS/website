<h1 class="text-center">Thank you for being an early adopter!</h1>

Please be aware that this is an **early development build** of carbonOS.
carbonOS is still unfinished. There **will** be breaking changes. carbonOS
**will not** automatically convert your data to new formats when upgrading
between development releases. There are still many quirks and unfinished
features that you will have to work around. Do *not* use this release in
production or in any other critically-important environments.

All that said, I'd greatly appreciate it if you tried out carbonOS and gave
me your thoughts! This has been a passion project of mine for the last 4+
years, and I'm finally ready to publish some of my work. I believe that
carbonOS's model has lots of potential and, once polished up a bit, will
be extremely usable as a daily-driver OS. However, this project will not
meet its full potential without community feedback and support.

So, sincerely, thank you for being one of the first few people to try my OS!
