title: Setting Up Some Infrastructure

I just wanted to post a really quick development update about the upcoming
carbonOS 2021.1: We're almost there!

Thanks to [Fosshost](https://fosshost.org), I've been able to set up some of
carbonOS's basic infrastructure over the last few days. We now have a
[Discourse](https://discourse.carbon.sh) instance up and running, as well as
the basic [repo](https://repo.carbon.sh). I've also published an early
snapshot of the 2021.1 ISO, which you can download and try from
[here](https://repo.carbon.sh/img/carbonOS-pre2021.1-installer.iso). I'm still
working on a real release process, but for now I have temporary GPG keys up and
can manually push content up.

I'm also finishing up work on carbonOS's initial setup. This week I implemented
the network selection screen. Now that Setup can get you online, the next step
is to implement the timezone selection page. After that, I'll be putting some
finishing touches on the OS itself, updating all the packages, and making a
release!

This was a really quick view into my progress over the last week. I plan on
posting more detailed development updates as large developments occur. I've also
just started my second year at university, so please be patient with my progress.
carbonOS has evolved drastically from its first release (way back when), and I'm
really excited for you guys to try it out. Expect a release announcement in the
coming weeks. Anyway, that's all for now!
